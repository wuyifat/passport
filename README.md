Take an arbitary image, if there is a face in it and satisfies the passport photo standard, make a passport photo out of it. The precess may includes face recognition, pixel level segmentation, white balance adjustment and background removal.  
  
Nice to have features:  
face angle detection and rotation  
eyeglasses removal
face reconstruction to make the face up to passport photo standard, like eye opening, expression adjustment and so on  
  
This is an on going project...
